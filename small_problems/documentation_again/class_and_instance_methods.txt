Locate the ruby documentation for methods 
File::path and File#path. How are they different?

Answer:
File::path is a Class Method that returns the string representation of the path
File.path('path') -> string 'path'
We need to use a Class Method directly on the class, like this example File.path

File#path is an Instance Method that returns the pathname 
used to create file as a string. Does not normalize the name
File.new("testfile").path -> 'testfile'
Instance methods are called on the objects.
